# UFOs
# Overview
Detailed analysis of UFO sightings is performed, such that users  are able to filter data on the basis of multiple criteria. In addition to filter on date, users are able to filter on the basis of the city, state, country, and shape. We have to add seperate tables and filters for  city, state, country, and shape. 
# Results
## Filter by Country
Content for canada is filtered by typing in ca, and it worked well. In the following image, entries for canada are shown.

# Summary
## Drawback
Filter works well by typing in "ca" and it will show all the entries for Canada. However, when complete word "Canada" is typed in, filter dosnot show any results.
## Recomendations
Few things can be improved in the website:
### Drop Down Menu for Various Filter
Currently, table is searched through by typing values into it. Drop down menu can be added showing all the values to be picked up. This option can be added to search for country and shape.
### Capability of Data Addition to Website
There should be a provision of addition of new data, regarding new cities and US and Canada.
### Improved Data Organisation
Data is not clean and doesnot look so organised. One side of a website has lots of empty space and all the data is pushed to another side.
